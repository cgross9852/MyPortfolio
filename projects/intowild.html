<p>Into the Wild Playlist</p>

<p>“Into the Unknown” - AURORA and Idina Menzel</p>

<p>This song reminds me of the very beginning of the book. “Alex” is traveling into the unknown and he is so excited to find himself and become one with nature. He looks forward to this trip and sees no danger in his plans.</p>

<p>“Help” - The Beatles</p>

<p>I chose this song because it generalizes the whole story. The song talks about not thinking you need help as a younger man but then coming to realize that you do need help and that you cannot just rely on yourself. Chris was very self-assured in the beginning of the book and felt as though he did not need help from anyone, however, in the end he could have really used some help.</p>

<p>“A Sadness Runs Through Him” - The Hoosiers</p>

<p>This song reminds me of the pain and burdens that Chris must have felt all throughout his life due to his own suffering. The sadness that ran through him his entire life eventually pushed him to isolate himself from anyone who could help him, and he allowed that sadness to control his interactions with others.</p>

<p>“I Want to Break Free” - Queen</p>

<p>Chris was looking for a way out of his unhappy life. He wanted to break free from the lies and the abuse and follow out his dreams doing something he thought he would love, like living off the land and going on an adventure.</p>

<p>“Blue Ridge Mountains” - Fleet Foxes</p>

<p>This song is so peaceful and calming. It makes me think about what Chris might have been feeling when longing to go to Alaska and live in the wild. It also reminds me of all the beautiful imagery used within the book to describe the wilderness. It gives me a feeling of peace, although the ending of this story is sad, there were beautiful parts throughout the story.</p>

<p>“If You Know That I’m Lonely” - FUR</p>

<p>One of the lyrics in this song says, “it’s safer if I 
Distance myself if there’s a way for me to not do what I have done for so long.” This reminds me a lot of the ways that Chris distanced himself from people, especially his family. He was unable to break anything down and see the pieces and he ultimately blamed himself for his loneliness.</p>

<p>“7 Years” - Lukas Graham</p>

<p>A major theme within this song is quickly moving through the big motions of life without taking the time to break them down and see the smaller details within each step. This reminds me of how Chris was just going through the motions to get to his big picture, life in the wild. But he never saw the details or the “trees,” just the forest. He was always moving and never took the time to think about his choices.</p>

<p>“Be Somebody” - Thousand Foot Krutch</p>

<p>Chris wanted to prove he could make it on his own, to be somebody. He felt as though the only way to prove himself, to prove that he could take care of himself was to go out into the wild on his own. But he gets caught up in the fantasy of being this wilderness man and that prevents him from learning from his own mistakes and heading others’ warnings. He thinks that everyone sees him as a stupid kid and so he refuses to listen to their warnings. Despite being ill-prepared, he pushes forward to prove himself.</p>

<p>“History Has Its Eyes on You” - Hamilton</p>

<p>Although this song is from a musical with a story of its own, it reminds me of the part in the book where John tells the stories of his own mistakes and sympathizes with Chris’ story. The lyrics say, “let me tell you what I wish I’d know when I was young and dreamed of glory.” That line reminds me of the way John told his own story, almost as if he were telling Chris this himself.</p>

<p>“Ghost” - Mystery Skulls</p>

<p>This song makes me feel the same kind of hopelessness that the end of our story does. After all this effort and running away, Chris ends up dead and, in a way, he finally gives up. The song says, “cause the world might do me in” and “this time I might just disappear.” Going out into the wild was Chris’ last hope and the last real chance he was giving life. But in the end even the adventure betrayed him, so he disappeared.</p>
